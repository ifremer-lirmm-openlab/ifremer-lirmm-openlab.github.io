## Software for loggers based on the IOT board

### LoRa logger for sea turtle tracking (version without GPS)

A LoRaWAN logger dedicated to sea turtle tracking that transmits real-time data of temperature, surface events and dive profile using the LoRa/LoRaWAN technology.

- More info on the project's [Wiki pages](https://gitlab.ifremer.fr/sb2-team/iot-tag/-/wikis/home)

*This device has been used within the IOT project for experimentations in Europa, Mayotte, Aldabra and Reunion (2021-2022).*

### LoRa logger for sea turtle tracking (version with GPS)

### LoRa logger for DCP monitoring

A LoRaWAN logger dedicated to real-time DCP monitoring.

- More info on the project's [Wiki pages](https://gitlab.ifremer.fr/sb2-team/dcp-iotboard-logger/-/wikis/home)

*This device has been used for experimentation with the CRPMEM in the Reunion Island (2024).*

### LoRa logger to monitor fishes survival rates (TAAF version)

A LoRaWAN logger dedicated to monitor survival rates of marine animals after capture and release. The device records underwater temperature and pressure data, then pops after a predifined date and sends the measurement throuhg LoRa while at surface.

- [https://gitlab.ifremer.fr/sb2-team/urelease-logger-taaf](https://gitlab.ifremer.fr/sb2-team/urelease-logger-taaf)

*This device has been used with the TAAF for experiments on sleeper sharks (2024).*

### Multi-sensor general purpose logger

A general purpose logger with no RF communication that read the accelero, the magneto, the temperature, pressure sensors and store the results in the embeded flash memory with compression technique. The configuration is onne through a console user interface, flash dump and quick plots automatized with Python scripts.

- [https://gitlab.ifremer.fr/sb2-team/iotboard-allinone-logger](https://gitlab.ifremer.fr/sb2-team/iotboard-allinone-logger)
- More info on the project's [Wiki pages](https://gitlab.ifremer.fr/sb2-team/iotboard-allinone-logger/-/wikis/home)

*This device has been used within the TALE project for experimentation on the ship OSIRIS II (2022).*

## Software for loggers based on the FISHNCHIP board

### Multi-sensor GPS LoRa Logger

A LoRaWAN GNSS logger based on the FISHNCHIP board that periodically sends GPS position and environmental measurements (pressure, temperature). The device is configured through a console user interface.

- [https://gitlab.ifremer.fr/sb2-team/loraship-fnc-gnss-logger](https://gitlab.ifremer.fr/sb2-team/loraship-fnc-gnss-logger)

*This device has been used within the LoRaShip project (2023-2024).*

## LoRa networks

### Dataflux agent

 To transfer data from various LoRa servers to a single InfluxDB database instance, we developed a lightweight Python agent called Dataflux, which establishes a continuous connection between the LoRa servers and the database using the MQTT protocol.

- More info on the project's [Wiki pages](https://gitlab.ifremer.fr/sb2-team/dataflux-agent/-/wikis/home)

### Private LoRa server with Chirpstack

Sources and executables for a private LoRa network dedicated to natural and remote sites with very limited internet acces.
This custom network is composed of a meshed network of secondary gateways that have no internet, a main gateway connected to the internet via satelite and a distant server that emulate a classical LoRa network and bridges with a Chirpstack LoRa server.

### LoRaShip simulator

Python scripts for the simulation and analysis of LoRa network performances in coastal and off-shore marine scenario.
